# RUBY-FILES

This is my first time trying out Ruby. I want to learn it because it could be beneficial for building my back-end development skills, esp. if I decide to go full-stack in the future. I currently have zero knowledge of Ruby, but based on my research, it's one of the top languages worth learning, so Iâ€™ll give it a try hahaha
